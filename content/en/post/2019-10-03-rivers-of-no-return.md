In last one month, I read a novel named "Rivers of no return" by Ane. After finished reading, I wondered real history in novel of 1978 ~ 2008 about Chinese commercial reform and evolution. Another book 'China Emerging 1978-2018' by Xiaobo Wu to me. This book described the big commercial and politic news in each year with vivid story and comments.
