## Stubborn

When talking about word **stubborn**, what come into my mind is a picture that an old man argue agianst young boy with electronic products addiction. Maybe it's my stereotype of old man. So I Google the **stubborn**, the very image below painted by _Louis C Moeller_ depicts every well with **stubborn**.
