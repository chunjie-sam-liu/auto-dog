This is Major Sam to Ground Control!

I'm stepping through the door.

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way.

And the stars look very different today.

For here.

Am I sitting in a tin can.

Far above the world.

Planet Earth is blue.

And there's nothing I can do.

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles.

I'm feeling very still.

And I think my spaceship knows which way to go.

Tell my wife and daughter I love her very much.
